# Resources for updating the dApp tutorial

These folders contain the in-progress files for different ways that I have tried to update the [dApp tutorial](https://docs.tezos.com/tutorials/dapp) but have failed for tooling or knowledge reasons.

- `ligo-1.13.12`: Updated contracts in LIGO and simplified frontend for how I'd do the tutorial without Taqueria; working through the first half of part 4
- `smartpy-0.24.0`: Contracts translated to SmartPy and simplified frontend for how I'd do the tutorial without Taqueria; working through the first half of part 4
- `smartpy-with-taqueria`: Updated instructions for how to run through the tutorial with SmartPy and Taqueria; incomplete but the simplified language may be helpful
